# CNCR-YOLO: A comprehensive optimization strategy for small target defect detection in injection molded parts
This is a small target defect detection algorithm
detect.py is a file that uses the trained model to test the specific training effect at this point.
train.py is the file that trains the model through the training set.
val.py is the file used to validate the trained model.
The data set in the data folder is the injection molding machine data set that we used for training.
Video 1 in the data folder is the field test of injection molding machine.
Video 2 in the data folder is a display of the current simple real-time detection.
Printed circuit board (PCB) defect data set in the https://robotics.pkusz.edu.cn/resources/dataset/.
